"""This code is to generate and to plot a wordcloud in Korean version. 
Of course it is possible to generate a simple wordcloud with the original codes, however
due to the major difference with English and complexity, the result from the original codes will not
be as perfect as we expected.

The major difference between English and Korean(Hangul) is that English can divide words by space(' ')
while Korean cannot divide words by space. To make a Korean sentence, every single noun has to combine with
articles without space(ex. I am --> 나는, 나:I 는:am).

For this reason, even though the text want to say 'I' in every appearance as '나는','나를', '나에게',
the original codes will separate these words as a different meaning and a different word.
'"""

"""To implement the codes, you must install konlpy package which is a module for natural language processing for Korean.

It provides a function with separating the main words and articles, and only extract the main words."""

"""So don't forget to install konlpy package!"""
